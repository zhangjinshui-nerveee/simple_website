"We should not fight our computers." -- How Linux Works.

## We should have full control of our computer

You can never understand every little detail or behavior of the software that you are using, I believe nobody can. However, we should reserve the right to do so instead of being told "xxx (the message on windows update". 

Open-source is definitely crucial for this philosophy. 

## Tools that can help us to be able to do so (What open-source software do I use as an electrical engineer?)
- vim
- embedded development: anything but labview
- cad: kicad, xx
- minimized but not none at all use of ai. Writing with ai is risky, you might dump tons of junk food in your mouth and your brain, but also your recipe.Chat-gpt is not trained with good writing resources, it's trained with numerous free bad-written articles or sentences. 
- manage everything with your terminal (powershell on windows). If possible, use linux?
