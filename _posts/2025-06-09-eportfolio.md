Have you ever struggled to settle down on the style of your personal website? Well, I have, a lot. There are just so many options on the internet, beautiful and free. I used to switch my website from one template to another all the time. I didn't do this for fun, every time I switch, I was literally urged to do so because I felt my previous one was so ugly and it disgusted me too much. If you felt the same way, shake hands. 

I took my whole bus time to think about this problem -- yes, one thing I really love about taking a bus over driving is that you can really use your time to think about all kind of strange or seemingly meaningless questions without worrying that your distraction might kill someone or yourself. I realized that the root cause for me obsessively changing my e-portfolio is my ambiguous interpretation of its function. It could be your cv, it could be your blog, it could be your gallery, it could be anything, but it can not be just anything. It has to serve ONE purpose for you, just you, and not the ones who developed those fancy templates. That's why the website repositories I picked from tons of others all end up looking ugly to me. Once the first impression or the freshness phased out, the conflict between the tastes of the original designer and your actual needs makes you feel uncomfortable everytime you visit your website. And this discomfort eventually accumulates into panic and disgust, especially when everyone is using the same template and trying to fill out all the categories that the original design has provided (hey, maybe because they don't know how to delete the entries). 

We do not necessarily have to suffer that. I figured out my needs -- my website should be a supplement to my cv. As I have only very limited space in my cv for my research and projects, some of them may lose their significance or the interesting stories. I decided to supply these materials on this website, include demonstrations as well as stories (comedy or tragedy) behind all these achievements on my cv. Meanwhile, I can't really be a real person on cv, I doubt that no one could. Therefore, I will also share some of my thoughts on work and life, like this one. 

A text-based website will serve all of my needs. That's it.
