I was struggling so much deciding a e-portfolio style for myself. 

I am not sophisticated enough to design one from scratch, however, there are numerous options online that is free and probably easy to deploy -- most of them don't even need you to get your hands dirty at all, just copying and pasting on github would do the job. Attempting, hah?

But as always, free is expensive. 

I kept switching from one template to another, always trying to add more features to my website so that people may think I am cool. But as every pursuit of the coolness that doesn't belong to you ends, this endeavor exhausted me and I gave up trying different fancy websites. 

I decided to figure out what I need my website to do first, instead of what it can do. To me, an e-portfolio is an appendix to my cv / resume. Therefore, just some details that I don't have space on my cv, as well as some blogs, are all I need to present on my website to build an honest yet efficient connection with people who might visit. 

And I ended up with this one. It's so simple that it does not seem to have been "designed". But it is. 
Simple is the eventual sophistication -- Da Vinci.
